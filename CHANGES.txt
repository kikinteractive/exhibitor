1.0.14 - June 7, 2012
=====================
* Removed eTag support - there are too many edge cases and it doesn't really save very much.

* Added Usage Listing feature to the Explorer tab. This produces a listing report starting
at a given path and producing: Path CreateDate ChildQty DeepChildQty.

* DefaultProperties now have more useful methods.

1.0.13 - May 29, 2012
=====================
* HTTP eTag support broke server UI updates.

* Exhibitor now supports upgrading the ZooKeeper install version by optionally having
the ZooKeeper Install Dir specify a directory and searching that directory for the ZooKeeper
install with the highest version number.

* UI work - prep for i18n.
